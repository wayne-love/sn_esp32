# eSpa

## Introduction

The [eSpa project](https://espa.diy) is an open source community for spa home automation, built around [firmware](https://espa.diy/firmware.html) (found in this GitHub repo) and a simple [hardware design](https://espa.diy/hardware.html) that you can build yourself, or [purchase pre-assembled](https://store.espa.diy/).

Learn more at the [eSpa website](https://espa.diy), and [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/faK8Ag4wHn).
